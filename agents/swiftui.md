# SwiftUI Shell Guide

Load this file before changing SwiftUI file layout, view-model structure, diff rendering wiring, or presentation surfaces. Crate boundaries live in [Architecture Guide](architecture.md); review marks and notes in [Review State Guide](review-state.md). Cross-shell user-visible gaps are listed in [Shell Feature Parity Guide](shell-parity.md) and refreshed at release.

└── Packages/JayJayDiffUI/   AppKit diff rendering: NativeDiffView at the root, sources grouped
                             into Gutter/, Notes/, SideBySide/, Rendering/, Text/, Media/;
                             own test target
```

Group sibling files into a responsibility folder once a feature grows past a few files (see `Repo/DAG/`); `project.yml` globs `Sources/JayJay`, so moves need no project edits — except `Shared/AccessibilityIdentifiers.swift`, which the UITest target references by path.

The ViewModel owns `JayJayRepo`; all jj operations go through it. `Core/` holds lifecycle and state; `Actions/` holds mutation verbs; all are `extension RepoViewModel` files.

## Conventions

- **JayJayDiffUI boundary**: the package declares the gutter-action protocols (`DiffGutterContextActions` and its `Selection`/`Edit`/`Review`/`Note` sub-protocols, one file each under `Gutter/`) plus the anchor/summary value types in `Notes/`; the app target conforms via `DiffSection` and its `+EditActions`/`+ReviewActions`/`+NoteActions` extensions. The package stays app-agnostic and calls back only through those protocols.
- **File splitting**: One primary type per file, named after the type (private helpers used only there stay put; a view keeps its `#Preview`). Split by responsibility, not line count: growing types that pick up a second job become `+Feature.swift` extension files (see `DAGView+*`, `DiffSection+*`, the `ViewModel/` folders); wide parameter lists become value types (e.g. `NoteAnchor`, `SplitSheetRequest`). Dense folders get responsibility subfolders (`Detail/FileList/`, `Repo/ContentView/`, the JayJayDiffUI `Gutter/`/`Notes/`/`Rendering/` layout).
- **Pinned paths**: `Shared/AccessibilityIdentifiers.swift` is referenced by exact path in `project.yml` (the UITests target compiles it directly); moving it breaks project generation. Everything else under `Sources/JayJay` is glob-included and moves freely.
- **Diff caching**: `Diff/DiffStore.swift` (`@Observable`) fronts an `actor DiffCache`, an LRU bounded by content bytes. Keys are content-addressed on the immutable commit id (never the mutable rev) plus compare side, whitespace mode, and path, so amends/rebases cannot serve stale diffs. `preload()` cancels the prior preload task.
- **Refresh pipeline** (`ViewModel/Core/RepoViewModel+Refresh.swift`): one cancel-and-replace `refreshTask`; FS-triggered refreshes are dropped while one is in flight; snapshots (e.g. `StatusBarSnapshot`) load off-thread and apply atomically. Commit-box drafts reseed only when the working-copy change id actually changes; `jj split` gives the remainder (the new `@`) a fresh change id while diff-edit extract keeps it, so in-app split must preserve the draft explicitly, and divergent siblings share one id, so detect `@` moving between them by description.

## Rendering Performance

- Keep row rendering and menu eligibility cheap: compute whole-graph indexes, lane aggregates, and selection ancestry once per input snapshot, not per row. Computed properties do not cache automatically, and context-menu builders may run before the menu opens. Invalidate cached results when any of their inputs change.
- Derive graph drawing and drag hit-testing from the same immutable `DAGGeometry`; do not publish row-frame measurements back into view state, because that can create layout feedback. Use observable geometry only when a measurement must change rendered output.
- Verify DAG hot-path changes with `DAGPerformanceTests` (12k-change fixture) and graph-width/hit-testing changes with `DAGGeometryTests`, both in `shell/mac/Tests/JayJayTests/`. These cover computation cost and deterministic geometry, not end-to-end keyboard or scrolling latency; measure the affected interaction separately when claiming a responsiveness improvement.

## Window Lifecycle

- Scene restoration is disabled everywhere: `.restorationBehavior(.disabled)` on every scene and `ApplePersistenceIgnoreState` registered in `JayJayApp.init`. Restoration opens the wrong scene at launch and resurrects blank repo windows.
- Frames are persisted explicitly (`App/Window/WindowFramePersistence.swift`) and `RepoWindowManager` routes the launch scene imperatively. Persist split-pane widths as settings driven by `.frame(width:)`, never `NSSplitView.autosaveName`.
- Closed windows linger in `NSApp.windows`: look windows up through `RepoWindowManager`'s live-window filter, capture the window weakly in NotificationCenter observers and unregister on close, and never `openWindow(value:)` for a value whose window already exists.
- `SceneBase` launches with `-ApplePersistenceIgnoreState YES`, which hides all of this; any launch-routing change must pass `LaunchRoutingRestoringScene`.

## Presentation Surfaces

Use repo-level presentation types from `RepoPresentation.swift` instead of ad hoc booleans.

- **Inline state**: pane-scoped no-data, first-run guidance, and recoverable section errors.
- **Toast** (`RepoOverlayState.toast` / `RepoToast`): non-blocking action feedback, success messages, conflict follow-up, and lightweight warnings. Keep it short and allow at most one direct action.
- **HUD** (`RepoOverlayState.loading`): temporary blocking busy states where further interaction would be misleading or unsafe. Prefer quiet refreshes.
- **Alert** (`RepoAlertState`): short blocking interruptions that need acknowledgement or a simple binary choice. No forms, long copy, or more than two meaningful actions.
- **Sheet** (`RepoModalState` + `SheetContainer`): forms, previews, richer explanations, multi-step flows, or confirmations needing more context than an alert.
- **Picker** (`Shared/Picker/PickerPanel.swift` + `PickerPanelRoot`): filterable toolbar pickers such as `RepoTitlePicker` and `BookmarkPicker` — a non-activating anchored `NSPanel` with a filter field, sectioned rows, and palette-style keyboard navigation. SwiftUI `.popover` (slow to open, focus-ring border) and `NSMenu` with attributed multi-line rows (no truncation control) were both rejected; do not reintroduce them. Row actions that open or switch windows must defer via `RunLoop.main.perform(inModes: [.default])`.

Do not escalate inline states into alerts or sheets just because they are errors. Scope the surface to the problem.
